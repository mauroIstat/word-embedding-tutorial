# Word Embedding Tutorial - Topic Modeling

This repository contains the code for hands-on sessions related to topic modeling. It is designed to help you understand the concepts and implementations of topic modeling techniques, including but not limited to LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and more advanced approaches based on word embeddings.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mauroIstat/word-embedding-tutorial.git
cd word-embedding-tutorial
```

### Install Dependencies

You can install the required dependencies using pip. It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing the packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
